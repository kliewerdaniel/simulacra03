  "recommendations": [
    "Since the psychological traits suggest a balanced approach in formality, try experimenting with varying levels of formality in your writing. For instance, start with a formal introduction, then ease into a more conversational style in the main content. This can help make your writing accessible while still respecting the norms of formal writing.",
    "To develop a more unique voice, consider infusing your natural speaking style into your written communication. Since your traits show moderate extraversion and agreeableness, your writing might benefit from a friendly, approachable tone that invites the reader into a dialog. Try reading your work aloud to see if it sounds like something you would naturally say in a conversation.",
    "To enhance the engagement of your texts, make frequent use of active voice given it aligns with analytical thinking and ensures clarity and dynamism in your sentences. For instance, instead of writing 'The meeting will be held by the team,' write 'The team will hold the meeting.' This active construction cuts down on word count and boosts impact.",
    "Given the moderate level of openness, push boundaries by occasionally incorporating unfamiliar or rare words into your work to enrich the vocabulary. This can be balanced with explanations or simpler synonyms in parentheses to maintain readability and enhance understanding.",
    "To enhance analytical thinking in your writing, frequently incorporate structured argumentation and present clear evidence or reasoning for each point you make. Use bullet points or numbered lists to outline arguments, which can help in maintaining a logical flow and keeping the reader engaged."
